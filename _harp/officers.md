**Major:** Computer Science

**Why you chose CS/IS:** In high school I took part in Technovation Challenge, a program that introduces high school girls to computer science and entrepreneurship. From there I interned at Kapor Capital and met women in the field who inspired me to pursue Computer Science as a major.

**Favorite CS/IS class:** Networks and Distributed Systems. Really interesting material, I learned a lot about how the internet works, and Professor Mislove was awesome.

## Vice President: Teresa Krause

**Where you've co-oped:** Hubspot

**Major:** Computer Science

## Treasurer: Shivanjali Singh

**Year:** 4th Year

**Where you've co-oped:** Goldman Sachs, Intuit

**Major:** Computer Science and Business Administration (Finance and Accounting concentrations)

**Why you chose CS/IS:** : I was exposed to computer science by my father who is a software developer, but I had zero experience with coding when I first started out at Northeastern. After Fundies 1, I realized that this major challenged me in the best way and I found that exhilarating! I chose to make CS my major because of the way it makes you think so logically but allows you to be creative at the same time. The idea of dissecting human logic into factions that can be fed into a computer to emulate that human logic is mind-blowing to me, I just want to learn more and more!

**Favorite CS/IS class:** Object Oriented Design (OOD) - I was able to apply CS principles at a higher level and delve deeper into coding topics

**Favorite way to waste time:** Walking around Boston, being an avid foodie, Netflix

## Co-Outreach: Jacqueline Ali

**Year:** Prisoner of Azkaban

**Where you've co-oped:** Galatea Associates

**Major:** Computer Science

**Why you chose CS/IS:** : When I was in fifth grade, I finished the PS2 game Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus and unlocked a "making of the game" video. That was when I first considered game programming as a job. I no longer want to develop games, but it was definitely the reason I got into tech. Now, I'm motivated by the freedom computer science gives you to create real-world change.

**Favorite CS/IS class:** Object-Oriented Design. Dr. Tov revamped the course, so I learned a ton of useful things right before going on co-op. The assignments were fun to complete. And thank the gods: he had us using IntelliJ. Down with Eclipse!

## Co-Outreach: Yifan Xing

**Year:** 2nd Year

## Public Relations: Emily Montgomery

**Year:** 5th Year

**Major:** Information Science

**Where you've co-oped:** West Texas IT Consulting, State Street Global Advisors

**Why you chose CS/IS:** I've always enjoyed messing around with computers and finding and creating new solutions to problems. I chose IS because I really enjoy the human aspect of courses like HCI and Software Project Management.

**Favorite CS/IS class:** HCI - we studied all sorts of technologies and how people interact with them and how to create accessible and intuitive designs. It made me rethink the way I design things so that people can use them to their full potential.

**Favorite way to waste time:** Netflixing and cooking.
